VHDL SHA-256 Module
===================

This code contains a simple SHA-256 module and a testbench for verifying that it works.

TODO
----
- [ ] Use in a simple design to see it run IRL on an FPGA (in progress)
- [ ] Optimize (constants in block RAM + other techniques from interesting papers)
- [ ] Run on SHMAC
- [ ] Make bitcoins
- [ ] Profit
